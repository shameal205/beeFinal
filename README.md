# beeFinal

For this repo, it is broekn up into two halves: UI end and Backend.

UI was developed on angular. When starting up the project, go one level inside and install "node_modules" using "npm install" and use "ng serve" following it to start the application.

Backend was developed with Spring boot and MySQL paired together. To get started simply running "BeeAppAplication.java" on a server.
